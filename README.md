#Angular 6 component

The component contains a drop-down list of languages. When the user changes the DDL selected value the below department form should be updated and populated with newly loaded data based on language selected value.
If the user makes any changes to department data and then changes the DDL, the pop up should be appeared to notify the user that “There are unsaved changes!” and allow the user to “Discard” or “Save” the changes.
If user select “Save” the changes should be saved then the form should be updated.
